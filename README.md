# Modular Force Field Sysetm
Yet another failed attempt to maintain this old mod. After deeper investigation I think write another force field mod from scratch or simply use WarpDrive mod is a better idea. So here is what I got from my attempt.

# Current Bugs of this mod
- Unfinished EnderIO recipes and Thermal Expansion recipes
- Extremely inefficient force field generating. See ItemProjectorModuleSphere
- Camouflage module not working
- Hard dependency to guide api
- Extractor can't be inserted using pipes
- Lacking documentation about cards. In fact, every card can get by interacting with different machines.
